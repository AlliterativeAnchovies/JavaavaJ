    First of all, why the hell can generics not take raw types? (but yet they can take arrays of raw types... heh)
    That is such a dumb decision that could be easily fixed without sacrificing any runtime speed.  Like, really,
    what the fudge Java.
    Secondly, why can I not declare functions without defining them? (baring making it and the class it is in 'abstract')
    If it's really that much of a problem, just make the compiler ignore function declarations without definitions.  They're
    really useful for being able to go ahead and write out everything you need for the class without implementing it.
