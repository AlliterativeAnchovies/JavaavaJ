		So, just a warning that this is kind of a bare-minimum xml parser.
		Here are some things to watch out for:
		Don't use comments or the funcky question mark tags
		Don't put less than or greater than signs anywhere except when starting a tag
		Don't worry about escaping "s, it's smart enough to know when the quotes end
		(actually, it's better to say that it's stupid enough to not understand why escaping
		quotes would be necessary in the first place... hehehe)
		Try to use as little whitespace as possible.  If you put weird whitespace inside tags,
		I can guarantee you that things will break.
		Sorry.
		Hehe.
		Also, it doesn't care about your linebreaks and tabs (like normal XML afaik) so
		if you're passing in a string that needs that, then manually type in the \n and \t.
		Finally, if you have a tag that, for whatever reason, both has children and has a value,
		the value shouldd always come before the children.
		
		---------------------TL;DR----------------------
		Don't use greater/less than signs except in tags
		No comments or funky question mark tags
		Don't use weird whitespace please...
		Tags that have a value AND children should always put the value first
			Ideally, though, you should just make the value its own child or attribute...
